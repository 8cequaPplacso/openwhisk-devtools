Cube Escape: Paradox is a unique game that combines a point-and-click adventure with a short film. You play as Dale Vandermeer, a detective who wakes up in a strange room with no memory of who he is or how he got there. You have to solve puzzles and find clues to escape the room and recover your memories. Along the way, you will encounter familiar characters and locations from the previous Cube Escape games and the Rusty Lake universe.
 
The game has two chapters, each with different puzzles and endings. The first chapter is free to play on Steam, but the second chapter costs $2.99 (or $1.79 if you buy it during the current promotion). The second chapter is more challenging and reveals more about the story and the meaning of "Paradox".
 
However, some people might not want to pay for the second chapter or wait for it to be available on Steam. They might search for a hacked version online that allows them to play it for free. But this is not a good idea for several reasons.
 
- First of all, downloading a hacked version of Cube Escape: Paradox - Chapter 2 might expose your device to viruses, malware, or other harmful software. You never know what kind of files you are getting from an untrusted source. You might end up damaging your device or compromising your personal information.
- Secondly, downloading a hacked version of Cube Escape: Paradox - Chapter 2 might ruin your gaming experience. You might miss out on important features, updates, or bug fixes that the developers have implemented in the official version. You might also encounter glitches, errors, or crashes that prevent you from enjoying the game properly.
- Thirdly, downloading a hacked version of Cube Escape: Paradox - Chapter 2 might disrespect the developers and their hard work. Rusty Lake is an independent studio that has been creating amazing games for years. They deserve to be supported and appreciated for their creativity and quality. By paying for the second chapter, you are showing them that you value their work and want them to continue making more games in the future.

Therefore, we recommend that you avoid downloading a hacked version of Cube Escape: Paradox - Chapter 2 and instead buy it from Steam or other official platforms. You will not only get a better and safer gaming experience, but also support a talented and passionate team of developers.
  
So, what can you expect from Cube Escape: Paradox - Chapter 2? Well, without spoiling too much, you can expect a lot of surprises, twists, and connections to the previous games and the short film. You will wake up in the same room as before, but things will be different this time. You will have to solve new and more challenging puzzles, some of which will require you to use your memory, logic, and creativity. You will also encounter old friends and enemies, some of whom might help you or hinder you along the way.
 
Cube Escape: Paradox - Chapter 2 is not only a great game on its own, but also a great complement to the short film. The game and the film are intertwined in many ways, and you will discover new details and meanings by playing and watching both. The game also features beautiful paintings handmade by Johan Scherft, an immersive and atmospheric soundtrack by Victor Butzelaar, and powerful voice-overs by Bob Rafferty and lead actor David Bowles. The game supports 14 different languages, so you can enjoy it in your preferred language.
 
If you are looking for a unique, never-before-seen, game/film crossover experience that will challenge your mind and immerse you in a surreal and mysterious world, Cube Escape: Paradox - Chapter 2 is the game for you. It is the tenth Cube Escape game and the thirteenth Rusty Lake game, but it is also a standalone experience that anyone can enjoy. However, if you want to get the most out of it, we recommend that you play the previous games and watch the short film first. You can find them all on Steam or on the official Rusty Lake website.
